**IMPORTANT**

Check what hardware revision you have BEFORE downloading a firmware update. Choosing the wrong file could result in a bricked device that will need to be
shipped back to RetroStage to fix.

The hardware version is always written at the top-right corner on the RetroBlaster circuit board itself.
