----------------------------
Version 2.2.1
----------------------------

**IMPORTANT** 
All users with a RetroBlaster Mini should update to this version.

- MMC3 save dumping/writing
- MMC2/4 ROM dumping

Changes for RetroBlaster 2.0 users:

- removed Atmel Flip program + 2.0 drivers from RetroBlaster software folder, direct download link will now be available from RetroBlaster 2.0 Wiki page.

----------------------------
Version 2.2.0
----------------------------

**IMPORTANT** 
This version (or later) is required by the RetroBlaster Mini. The RetroBlaster Mini will not be recognized by any version before this release.

NEW for RetroBlaster Mini:

- File menu has "Update Firmware" feature for easy updating on the RetroBlaster Mini. This feature is NOT compatible with the RetroBlaster 2.0.

- All routines have been modified to support the RetroBlaster Mini, while keeping compatibility with the original RetroBlaster 2.0.

- SA-1, CX4, and SDD-1 support have been added for SNES dumping with the RetroBlaster Mini. These are not compatible with the RetroBlaster 2.0 due to hardware limitations.


NEW for all models:

- Support added for new SNES Blaster and Sega Blaster products.


Bug fixes:

- adjusted MMC5 dumping routine, should fix CHR dumping errors
- fixed Sega Genesis issue where SRAM size was detected incorrectly
- fixed an issue where the software could hang after failing to dump a NES game

----------------------------
Version 2.1.6
----------------------------

NEW:

- Autodetect NES games when dumping (WIP)
	This scans an internal db and compares a checksum against the first few KB of the inserted NES game. If it matches, then it knows PRG/CHR/RAM/Mapper data for 
	game. Can use file "nesdb.txt" in RetroBlaster folder to add custom games or games not in db already, formatting MUST MATCH EXAMPLE IN TEXT FILE - it goes CRC32 of 
        first 4KB PRG,Mapper number, PRG size(in bytes), CHR size(in bytes), does it use battery (1 for yes, 0 for no), mirroring (bit[0] of byte[6] in INES header), and game 
        name.

- Automatic GBA file size detection
- Added option for manually choosing save type for N64 games when dumping - fixes some games.

- Automatic GBA ROM patching (WIP) - this feature is used by GBA Blasters so that games that use EEPROM or Flash now save properly without patching beforehand!
- Added a "Write Save" button for writing downloaded/backed up save files to the GBA Blaster - works with most emulator (.sav) save files!

CHANGES:

- Moved "Check Firmware" button to the "About" menu.
- Minor GUI changes
