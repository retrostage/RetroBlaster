RetroBlaster Software Changelog
----------------------------
----------------------------
Version 2.2.7
----------------------------

NEW:
- Massive update for NES dumping! You can now create your own scripts that can be used to dump games that use mappers that aren't supported natively. Also supports dumping SRAM.

FIX:
- Added support for N64 homebrew header that specifies save type, so 4K or 16K EEPROM should set automatically when writing a libdragon game to the N64 Blaster. Also added a 'Force EEP' option, if for some reason the game requires a specific EEPROM save type but doesn't have the proper byte set in the ROM header, you can manually force a specific EEPROM size.

----------------------------
Version 2.2.0
----------------------------

**IMPORTANT** 
This version (or later) is required by the RetroBlaster Mini. The RetroBlaster Mini will not be recognized by any version before this release.

NEW for RetroBlaster Mini:

- File menu has "Update Firmware" feature for easy updating on the RetroBlaster Mini. This feature is NOT compatible with the RetroBlaster 2.0.

- All routines have been modified to support the RetroBlaster Mini, while keeping compatibility with the original RetroBlaster 2.0.

- SA-1, CX4, and SDD-1 support have been added for SNES dumping with the RetroBlaster Mini. These are not compatible with the RetroBlaster 2.0 due to hardware limitations.

----------------------------
Version 2.1.6
----------------------------

NEW:

- Autodetect NES games when dumping (WIP)
	This scans an internal db and compares a checksum against the first few KB of the inserted NES game. If it matches, then it knows PRG/CHR/RAM/Mapper data for 
	game. Can use file "nesdb.txt" in RetroBlaster folder to add custom games or games not in db already, formatting MUST MATCH EXAMPLE IN TEXT FILE - it goes CRC32 of 
        first 4KB PRG,Mapper number, PRG size(in bytes), CHR size(in bytes), does it use battery (1 for yes, 0 for no), mirroring (bit[0] of byte[6] in INES header), and game 
        name.

- Automatic GBA file size detection
- Added option for manually choosing save type for N64 games when dumping - fixes some games.

- Automatic GBA ROM patching (WIP) - this feature is used by GBA Blasters so that games that use EEPROM or Flash now save properly without patching beforehand!
- Added a "Write Save" button for writing downloaded/backed up save files to the GBA Blaster - works with most emulator (.sav) save files!

CHANGES:

- Moved "Check Firmware" button to the "About" menu.
- Minor GUI changes
