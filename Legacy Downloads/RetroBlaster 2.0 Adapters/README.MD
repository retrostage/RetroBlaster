These are the Gerber (PCB manufacturing files) used by places like JLCPCB or PCBway, though places like OshPark will likely accept them as well.

The cartridge connectors used on these adapters are the same pitch (pin spacing) as original cartridge slots, but any 3rd party connector off of AliExpress or eBay are likely to fit fine.

The resistor on the N64 adapter is a 1K ohm in a 1206 SMD package.

The pin headers used for the sides of each adapter are 30 pin, 2.54mm (0.100") spacing, like these: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/harwin-inc/M20-9993045/3921286

Any size pin header should work, just break off the extra pins that aren't needed. 

There is no license for these - feel free to do with them as you will!
