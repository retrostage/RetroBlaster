These are the Gerber (PCB manufacturing files) used by places like JLCPCB or PCBway, though places like OshPark will likely accept them as well.

The cartridge connectors used on these adapters are the same pitch (pin spacing) as original cartridge slots, but any 3rd party connector off of AliExpress or eBay are likely to fit fine. N64 and SNES connectors use 2.50mm spacing instead of the normal 2.54mm for the cartridge connectors, so make sure you ask the seller if they will work.

The resistor on the N64 adapter is a 1K ohm in a 1206 SMD package. All other adapters use only the cartridge slot and the pin headers for parts, so they are very simple to assemble.

The pin headers used for the sides of each adapter are 30 pin, 2.54mm (0.100") spacing, like these: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/harwin-inc/M20-9993045/3921286

Any size pin header length should work, just break off the extra pins that aren't needed. For example, buying a 40-pin header works fine - just break off the extra 10 pins.

There is no license for these - feel free to do with them as you will - but there is also NO warranty, and NO technical support.
