Software and firmware zip files for the RetroBlaster cart programmer/dumper

The most recent versions, as well as old archived versions, will be posted here.

For software zip files, download the latest release from the Releases section on the right.

For firmware hex files, click on the link for the firmware hex file, and on the right side of the screen should be a button that says "RAW". Right-click that button and select "Save link as..". 


**IMPORTANT!!**

Check what hardware revision you have BEFORE downloading a firmware update. Choosing the wrong file could result in a bricked device that will need to be shipped back to RetroStage to fix.

The hardware version is always written at the top-right corner on the RetroBlaster circuit board itself.
