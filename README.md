Software and firmware zip files for the RetroBlaster cart programmer/dumper

The most recent versions, as well as old archived versions, will be posted here.

For software zip files, click on the file and there should be a button that says "Download". Click that to save to your computer.

For firmware hex files, click on the link for the firmware hex file, and on the right side of the screen should be a button that says "RAW". Right-click that button and select "Save link as..". 


# 3D PRINT FILES
There is a screw cover that can be 3D printed to make it more comfortable to insert and remove cartridges from the
RetroBlaster cartridge slots. These can be glued down over top of the screws to give the end-user a better place to
press down on when inserting or removing carts.

Requirements:
0.2mm layer height
0.4mm line width
20% (or better) infill density
