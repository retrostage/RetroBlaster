**IMPORTANT!!**

For original RetroBlaster, RetroBlaster 2.0C or 2.0D users, check what hardware revision you have BEFORE downloading a firmware update. Choosing the wrong file could result in a bricked device that will need to be shipped back to RetroStage to fix.

The hardware version is always written at the top-right corner on the RetroBlaster circuit board itself.

**FOR WINDOWS 10 (and up) USERS on RetroBlaster 2.0D hardware**

If you're on Windows 10, and have the RetroBlaster 2.0D hardware revision of the RetroBlaster, you will need to download the usbFix.bat program and run it as Administrator (right click the file and select Run as administrator). Follow the prompts. This file is located in the Hardware 2.0D firmware folder on this repo.
This will fix the USB descriptor error that some users were seeing, and it seems to be specific to Windows 10.
