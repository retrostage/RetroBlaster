Software and firmware zip files for the RetroBlaster cart programmer/dumper

The most recent versions, as well as old archived versions, will be posted here. Other download links are available on the bottom of this readme.

For software zip files, download the latest release from the Releases section on the right.

For firmware hex files, click on the link for the firmware hex file, and on the right side of the screen should be a button that says "RAW". Right-click that button and select "Save link as..". 




**IMPORTANT!!**

Check what hardware revision you have BEFORE downloading a firmware update. Choosing the wrong file could result in a bricked device that will need to be shipped back to RetroStage to fix.

The hardware version is always written at the top-right corner on the RetroBlaster circuit board itself.

**FOR WINDOWS 10 USERS**
If you're on Windows 10, and have the 2.0D hardware revision of the RetroBlaster, you will need to download the usbFix.bat program and run it as Administrator (right click the file and select Run as administrator). Follow the prompts.
This will fix the USB descriptor error that some users were seeing, and it seems to be specific to Windows 10.
